# Title: Paper and paperboard production for cwf scenario. Improving efficiency coefficients by 10% (linear increase from 2020 to 2050) and by 20% by 2100 relative to default coefficients.
# Units: GJ per kg (EJ of energy per Mt of paper and paperboard) for paper and paperboard; unitless (EJ energy per EJ heat) for process heat.  
# Column types: cccccnnnn
