# Title: CWF adjustments to aluminum default coefficients (multiplied by defaults to obtain CWF values) - note no adjustments to alumina input
# Units:  alumina input is unitless (Mt alumina per Mt aluminum); all others are GJ per kg (EJ of energy per Mt of alumina/aluminum)
# Column types: cccccnnn
