# Title: Demand income elasticity as a function of per-capita industrial output
# Units: GJ per person per year for pc.output_GJ; Unitless for inc_elas
# Description: inc_elas: income elasticity (unitless); pc.output_GJ: per-capita output in GJ per person per year, Steel production is corrected for real production in 2020 (based on gssp2), and future demand changes refer to relevant studies (Wang et al,2022, doi: 10.13198/j.issn.1001-6929.2021.11.11). Default assumptions in GCAM Global have been used for other demand.
