# Title: Electricity technology capital costs
# Units: 1975$/kW
# Source: ATB temp update
# Future improvement is based on the maximum % reduction that the literature deems likely and a rate corresponding to the maturity level of the technology
# Note that some technologies are the same as another with additional equipment (i.e. CCS) for those technologies the improvement is on the additional equipment
# Capital cost of gas CT is derived from AEO report Table 3 (https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/electricity.pdf)
