# Title: CWF adjustments to cement default coefficients (multiplied by defaults to obtain CWF values) - note no adjustments to process heat cement energy inputs. 
# Comments Limestone inputs assume widespread adoption of cement manufacturing processes requiring lower CaO inputs including supplementary cementitious materials such as blast furnace slag + uncalcined limestone 
# Units: Fraction
# Column types: ccccnnn
