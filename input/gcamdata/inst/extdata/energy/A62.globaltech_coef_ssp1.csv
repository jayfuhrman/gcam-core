# Title: Default coefficients for DAC. DAC to liquids reflect carbon capture input coefficients only, with H2 production coefs added downstream
# Units: airCO2 input is unitless (MtC from the atmosphere per Mt dac demand); all others are GJ per kg C (EJ of energy per Mt C). DAC to liquids is also unitless (GJ/GJ)
# Column types: ccccnnnn
