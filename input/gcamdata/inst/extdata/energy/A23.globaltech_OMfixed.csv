# Title: Electricity technology fixed operations and maintenance costs
# Units: 1975$/kW/yr
# Source: ATB temp fix
# Future improvement is based on the maximum % reduction that the literature deems likely and a rate corresponding to the maturity level of the technology
# Note that some technologies are the same as another with additional equipment (i.e. CCS) for those technologies the improvement is on the additional equipment
