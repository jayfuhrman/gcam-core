# Comments: Based on Roberts et al 2010 supplementary spreadsheet slow pyrolisis for biochar production requires 3.655 tons of switchgrass and also 211.19 MJ of natural gas per ton of biochar. Since the co-product is 20095 MJ of syngas we do not include energy inputs to the process and in the co-products we subtract the enegry input for the pyrolisis process
