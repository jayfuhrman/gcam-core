# File: A23.subsector_interp_cwf_adj.csv
# Title: Electricity subsector shareweight interpolations to adjust for CWF case. These years need to match with years in the shareweight definition files (e.g. A23.subsector_shrwt_renew_R_cwf_adj.csv)
# Units: Unitless share-weights
# Source: None (assumptions)
# Column types: ccccic
