# Title: Secondary outputs for biochar production
# Units: GJ out / kg biochar
# Column types: ccccn
# Comments: Taking assumptions from Roberts et al 2010 SI spreadsheet we have 20095 MJ of syngas co-produced. We subtract the 211.19 MJ of natural gas that are needed for the slow pyrolisis process and we model the net here
